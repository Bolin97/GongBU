# 天功 [原名：工部(GongBU)]: 大模型可视化微调部署一站式平台

## 功能
1.支持9种高效微调方法和2种全量微调方法(LOMO, SFT)对全部开源大语言模型进行训练

2.用户使用huggingface或魔塔链接自定义下载任意开源大模型

3.全流程特性：训练前高质量数据筛选、训练中性能实时检测与日志记录、训练后模型一键部署


## 为何更名?

工大上下摞起来是"天", "功"取自哈工大的校训"功夫到家"

原名工部取自三省六部制中掌管营造工程事项的机关"工部"

## 为何代码不见了?
因项目维护需要, 现将源代码清空, 待新功能开发完成后会择机重新开源本项目。

# TGong [Formerly: GongBU]: An All-in-One Visualization Platform for Fine-tuning and Deploying Open-sourced LLMs

## Features
1.Supports training of all open-source large language models using 9 efficient fine-tuning methods and 2 full fine-tuning methods (LOMO, SFT).

2.Allows users to download any open-source large model via custom links from Hugging Face or Motta.

3.End-to-end capabilities: high-quality data filtering before training, real-time performance monitoring and logging during training, and one-click model deployment after training.

## Why the Name Change?
"T" (天) is derived from the last characters of "HIT" (Harbin Institute of Technology).

"Gong" (功) is taken from HIT's motto: "Mastery through Hard Work" (功夫到家).

The original name "GongBU" was inspired by the historical "Ministry of Works" (工部) from the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which oversaw construction and engineering affairs.

## Why is the Code Missing?
Due to project maintenance, the source code has been temporarily removed. It will be re-released once new features are fully developed.
